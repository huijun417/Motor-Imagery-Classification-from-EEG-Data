# Motor-Imagery-Classification-from-EEG-Data
C247 Deep Learning and Neural Network


We explored the classification of human motor imagery based on electroencephalography (EEG) data. The dataset we will be using for this project is BCI competition IV dataset 2a. Our goal for this project is implement 3 network architectures: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a CNN afterwards to classify, and a CNN with Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for both spatial and temporal features. In addition to these varying network architectures we explored the following preprocessing methodologies to help our networks train: wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) to extract signal information in frequency-time domain, cropped training that subsamples the original data along the time axis, and a method that combines max pooling, averaging and subsampling. Out of these, our best network architecture was the LSTM + CNN architecture with preprocessing for spatial features which achieved about 73% test accuracy followed by a regular CNN with preprocessing which achieved about 72% accuracy. The VAE+CNN with preprocessing was able to achieve varying accuracies from 67-72%.
